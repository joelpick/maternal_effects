What have previous studies shown

modelling maternal environment and not maternal genetic will inflate h2 
(clement et al, kruuk and hadfield)


to do 
- sort out asreml
- does thiese half-sib results hold in deer/blue tits
- what does paternal genetic effects do
	- does it go into Va and Vme?

Questions
- whata happens to Va
- whats the bias in the total Va
- are tehir biases in the direct genetic maternal covarainces, depending on what is fitted
- how things are changed when treating as a trait of the mother.
